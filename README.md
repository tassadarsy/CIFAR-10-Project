+ **Versions**
  + v1.0: The original model with only 1 layer. ReLu as activation function and max pooling for pooling layer.
  + v2.0: The model with 4 layers. Dropout is added with a constant rate 0.3.
  + v2.1: Data argumentation added into the pre-processing steps.
  + v3.0: The model with 6 layers. Also batch normalization is added into the model and activation function changed to elu. Dropout rate is changed to 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4, respectively.
  + v4.0: Max pooling focuses on edges detection hence average pooling is adopted which improves around 5% accuracy.

+ Remark: Data is imported by keras commmands.
